# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-tac-toe is a very popular game, so letâ€™s implement an automatic Tic-tac-toe game using Python.numpy and random Python libraries are used to build this game. Instead of asking the user to put a mark on the board, code randomly chooses a place on the board and put the mark. It will display the board after each turn unless a player wins. If the game gets draw, then it returns -1.
